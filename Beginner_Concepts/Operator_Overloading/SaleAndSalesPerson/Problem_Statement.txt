 Create two classes. The first, named Sale, holds data for a sales transaction. Its private data members include the day of the month, amount of the sale, and the salesperson’s ID number. The second class, named Salesperson, holds data for a salesperson, and its private data members include each salesperson’s ID number and last name. Each class includes a constructor to which you can pass the field values. Create a friend function named display()that is a friend of both classes and displays the date of sale, the amount, and the salesperson ID and name. Write a short main() demonstration program to test your classes and friend function.
