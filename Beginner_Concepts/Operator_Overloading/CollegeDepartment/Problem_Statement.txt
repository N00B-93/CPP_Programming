                    Complete the following tasks:
a. Design a CollegeDepartment class. Include fields for the department name (for example “Mathematics”), the department chair’s name (for example, “Lewis”), an integer that holds the number of classes offered by a department (for example, 10), and a string pointer that points to the individual courses offered by the department (for example, “MAT101”). Create two constructors. The default constructor assigns appropriate default values to the fields.
The other constructor accepts parameters for the department name, department chair’s
name, and number of courses and assigns them to their respective fields, and also prompts the user for the names of all the courses offered.

b. Overload an insertion operator for the class.

c. Overload > and < operators that compare CollegeDepartments based on number of courses offered.

d. Overload an = operator to assign one CollegeDepartment to another.

e. Write a main() function that declares an array of four CollegeDepartment objects. In a loop, prompt the user for a department name, chair name, and number of courses, then pass those arguments to the constructor to create a temporary CollegeDepartment. (The
constructor then gets the individual course names from the user.) Assign each entered department to a spot in the array. After all the CollegeDepartment objects have been entered, display them in a loop.

f. Modify the main()function to also display the CollegeDepartment objects with the most and fewest number of courses.
