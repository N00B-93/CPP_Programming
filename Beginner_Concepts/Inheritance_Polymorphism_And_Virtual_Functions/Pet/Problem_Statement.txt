Define a Pet class that stores the pet’s name, age, and weight. Add appropriate constructors, accessor functions, and mutator functions. Also define a function named getLifespan that returns a string with the value “unknown lifespan.”

Next, define a Dog class that is derived from Pet. The Dog class should have a private member variable named breed that stores the breed of the dog. Add mutator and accessor functions for the breed variable and appropriate constructors. 

Redefine the getLifespan function to return “Approximately 7 years” if the dog’s weight is over 100 pounds and “Approximately 13 years” if the dog’s weight is under 100 pounds.

Next, define a Rock class that is derived from Pet. Redefine the getLifespan function to return “Thousands of years.”
 
Finally, write a test program that creates instances of pet rocks and pet dogs that exercise the inherited and redefined functions.
