Define a class named Payment that contains a member variable of type float that stores the amount of the payment and appropriate accessor and mutator functions. Also create a member function named paymentDetails that outputs an English sentence describing the amount of the payment.

Next, define a class named CashPayment that is derived from Payment. This class should redefine the paymentDetails function to indicate that the payment is in cash. Include appropriate constructor(s).

Define a class named CreditCardPayment that is derived from Payment. This class should contain member variables for the name on the card, expiration date, and credit card number. Include appropriate constructor(s). Finally, redefine the paymentDetails function to include all credit card information in the printout.

Create a main function that creates at least two CashPayment and two CreditCardPayment objects with different values and calls to paymentDetails for each.
