Create a class named RealEstate that has data members to hold the price of a house, the number of bedrooms, and the number of baths. Member functions include overloaded insertion and extraction operators. 
Write a main()function that instantiates a RealEstate object, allows the user to enter data, and displays the data members entered. 
The main() function should display an appropriate thrown error message if non-numeric or negative
values are entered for any of the data members.
